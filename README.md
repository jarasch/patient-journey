# Patient Journey on Synthetic Patient Data
With this repository we want to provide solutions for storing highly heterogenous patient data. We provide queries and visualization solutions with Neo4j.

# Source Data
Synthea<sup>TM</sup> is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. The goal is to output synthetic, realistic (but not real), patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.
